Patients can register, book appointments, track their status, and update their recovery status. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of epidemic disease details, allowing day and month-wise filtering. Users can download patient details and access graphical representations of epidemic cases and recovery rates for informed decision-making. This streamlined approach combines mathematical modeling and machine learning with practical healthcare management, fostering a proactive and data-driven response to epidemics.
